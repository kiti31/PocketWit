# PocketWit
#### This app was for a group project.


### Introduction 
The majority of students attending at least one online course has almost multiplied over the last five years. Online students face the difficulty of balancing their educational commitments with their family or full-time career, which is definitely not a simple feat. Technology has helped students have a better control academic learning by offering everything from study aids and testing resources to time-management applications.

Our application, Pocket Wit is an Android based application that can be used during lessons and applied to the studentâ€™s life outside of the classroom. This application does not require the use of a network connectivity which save a lot mobile data for the students. The motivation behind our application is to provide options for how students can use technology and do their work creates pathways to learning for all students. Besides that, Pocket Wit eliminates the need for paper, writing utensils and other school supplies. The use of educational apps undoubtedly serves to preserve trees.

Some of the functions included are, a note-taking function, a quiz function which includes the actual quiz itself with flashcards to go over them as a study material and a medical history function to review any health information. The concept of Pocket Wit is to provide all these functionalities in a single app.
In order to build our app, Pocket Wit, we used Android Studio. With Android Studio, the structured code modules allowed us to divide our project into units of functionality that we could independently build, test and debug.
